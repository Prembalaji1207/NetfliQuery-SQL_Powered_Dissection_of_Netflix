### **Overview**

This project constitutes a detailed and methodical exploration of Netflix's catalog of movies and television shows, leveraging the power of SQL for data extraction, transformation, and insight generation. The primary objective is to derive actionable business intelligence from the dataset by addressing a series of analytically driven queries.

The analysis serves to uncover distribution patterns, content trends, and behavioral insights that can aid in strategic decision-making for content curation, regional targeting, and user engagement initiatives.

---

### **Objectives**

* To examine the **distribution of content types**, specifically contrasting movies and TV shows, to understand content composition on the platform.
* To determine the **most prevalent content ratings** across different types, providing insights into content maturity and audience targeting.
* To **analyze content metadata**, including release years, countries of production, and duration metrics, in order to identify regional and temporal trends.
* To perform **content segmentation and classification** based on specific filters, such as director names, genre keywords, or thematic descriptions (e.g., violence, crime).
* To identify and quantify high-performing entities (countries, genres, actors, etc.) that contribute significantly to Netflix’s content portfolio.

---

### **Approach**

The project utilizes SQL as the core querying language to perform:

* Aggregations and grouping for frequency analysis
* Filtering and window functions for ranking
* String parsing for multi-valued fields (e.g., countries, cast members)
* Date and time functions for recency analysis
* Conditional logic for content categorization

Each query is structured to address a distinct business question and to provide interpretable results that align with data-driven decision-making principles.

---

### **Expected Outcomes**

* An in-depth breakdown of content type distribution and release patterns
* Identification of high-content-producing countries and genres
* Discovery of the most common rating standards by type
* Recognition of key contributors (e.g., directors, actors) across markets
* Thematic classification of content based on descriptions
